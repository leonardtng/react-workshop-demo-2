  Covid-19 Data fetch

## ❓ Notes

The objective of the second session of Introduction to React is to call open APIs and pass the data down as props to child components. Do use the code here as reference if you encounter any obstacles! You can view the code for a beefed up Covid-19 data fetch example website [here](https://github.com/leonardtng/fancy-covid-data), and a live demo of it can be found [here](http://fancy-covid-data.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/)
